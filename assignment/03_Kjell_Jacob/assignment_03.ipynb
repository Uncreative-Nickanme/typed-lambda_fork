    "2. We can use ```dict.pop(key)``` or ```del dict[key]``` to remove a single costumer by using their name as a key. If we wanted to remove more than one costumer at a time, we should start by listing the names of the costumers we want to remove (e.g. by using a list): ```to_remove = ['Name1', 'Name2',..]```. Now we can use a list comprehension and one of the functions mentioned before on all elements of this list to remove those costumers: ```[balances.pop(name) for name in to_remove]```."
